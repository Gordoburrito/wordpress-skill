# ACF WordPress Skills

This project manages ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) for a headless WordPress site. Three skills handle the full lifecycle: schema editing, deployment, and content management.

## When to use which skill

- **Building a page from a design/screenshot** — read `skills/workflow.md` first, then follow the skill chain.
- **Creating or modifying ACF field groups** — read `skills/acf-schema-edit.md`.
- **Deploying schema to WordPress** — read `skills/acf-schema-deploy.md`.
- **Reading or updating page/post content** — read `skills/wp-acf-content-api.md`.
- **Configuring paths for your environment** — read `skills/config.md`.
